# üìö Affluences Reverse Engineering (Unofficial)

This script **fetches all library sites from the Affluences API** (category=Library), filters those located in **√éle-de-France**, retrieves detailed information for each site, and extracts available seat counts (when present). The reason I made this is because I wanted to find libraries nearby, and usually: bigger seat count == better library == better chances to find a seat.

It generates:
- A **CSV file** listing all enriched libraries and their metadata.
- An **interactive map (HTML)** with markers showing seat availability and occupancy.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: Please don't hurt me, this is an **unofficial reverse engineering project** for educational purposes only üò≠. It would theoretically work, but only IF you run main.py, at which point, it might or might not be against affluence's ToS.
